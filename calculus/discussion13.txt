1.  T/F: The area between curves is always positive.

True! Any way you slice it, there is a shaded region... The area under one curve is necessarily greater than the area under another (unless the two curves are actually just the same function, in which case there is no shaded region).  Sometimes, two functions will intersect in many places, and there is an illusion of "negative area".  In such a case, we may have to break up the calculation into a series of intervals and sum them.

2. T/F: Calculus can be used to find the area of basic geometric shapes.

True!  The area bounded by the edges of a regular polygon can be represented as functions, and the difference of their definite integrals will give the area.

3. In your own words, describe how to find the total area enclosed by y = f(x) and y = g(x).

Assuming the area is actually closed by some intersections, that the two functions don't extend infinitely without intersection, we can take the difference of the definite integrals as in number 3.  This process is generalized for all bounded regions.

4. Describe a situation where it is advantageous to find an area enclosed by curves through integration with respect to y instead of x.

I suppose that it's useful when you need horizontal "slices" instead of vertical ones.  I can't actually think of a concrete example where you couldn't simply subtract the integral with respect to x from some greater known area to arrive at the same answer.  My instincts suggest that there is a solid statistical application that I'm missing.
